Task 12 Create a java class file called Laptop.java. The Laptop.java class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the name of the laptop, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE
2. a private field to store the graphic cards' capacity in GBs, as a primitive byte type value.
3. a private field to store the ram capacity in GBs, as a primitive byte type value.
4. a private field to store the price of the laptop in INR, as a primitive double type value.
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
   toString() and the hashCode() methods. Create a java class file called LaptopComparison.java. The class should
   contain the following two methods:
1. public Set<Laptop> getGamingLaptops
   (List<Laptop> laptops, byte ramCapacity, byte graphicsCardCapacity) {} This method will return all the laptops which
   have a ram capacity of at least (or more) as specified in the argument, AND a graphics card capacity (or more) as
   specified in the argument. The returning set from the method should be sorted in a decreasing order of their price,if
   price is same use RAM, is RAM is same, use graphics.
2. public Set<Laptop> sortGamingLaptops(Set<Laptop> laptops) {} This method will sort the gaming laptops for the
   getGamingLaptops() method. The set of the laptops should be sorted in a decreasing order of their price. Create a
   separate execution java class called Main.java and call both the methods given above!
