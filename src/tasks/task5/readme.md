Task 5 Create a java class file called Teacher.java. The Teacher.java class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the employee ID of a teacher, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE!
2. a private field to store the name of a teacher, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE!
3. a private field to store the salary of a teacher, as a primitive double type value.
4. a private field to store the list of subjects that the teacher teachers, as a List<String> (list of String).
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
   toString() and the hashCode() methods. Create a java class file called TeacherHelper.java. The class should contain
   the following two methods:
1. public List<Teacher> findSubjectTeacher(List<Teacher> allTeachers, String subjectName) {} This method input a List of
   Teacher type as an argument and a String type value and returns a list of Teacher type. This method will find all
   such teachers in the allTeachers list that have the subject subjectName. Ideally, there should be more than a few
   teachers for the same subject.
2. public Set<Teacher> getBusyTeachers(List<Teacher> allTeachers) {} This method inputs a List of Teacher type as an
   argument and returns a Set of Teacher type. A busy teacher is a teacher that has at least 3 or more subjects to
   teach. If the list contains duplicate elements, make sure that the duplicate items are not returned from the method.
   Increase the salary of such teachers by 5% Create a separate execution java class called Main.java and call both the
   methods given above!
