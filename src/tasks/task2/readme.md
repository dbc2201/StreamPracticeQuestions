## Task 2

Create a java class file called `Student.java`. The `Student.java` class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the class roll number of a student, as a primitive `byte` type value.
2. a private field to store the name of a student, as a reference `String` type value. **This should be immutable!**
3. a private field to store the parent's/guardian's contact number of a student, as a primitive `long` type value.
   **This should be immutable!**
4. a private field to store the marks, as a primitive `double` type value.
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the `equals()`,
   `toString()` and the `hashCode()` methods.

Create a java class file called `TestResultGenerator.java`. The class should contain the following two methods:

1. ```java
   public HashSet<String> getDetailsOfFailedStudents(Set<Student> studentSet) {}
   ```
   This method inputs a Set of Student type and returns a HashSet of String type. A single element in the returning
   HashSet will be a String that contains the concatenated name and parent's contact number of a student, e.g.
   ["Divyansh-1234657890", "Vaibhav-1118529630", "Neeraj-1593574568"]

2. ```java
   public Set<Student> sortStudentsForRanking(HashSet<Student> studentSet) {}
   ```
   This method inputs a Set of Student type and returns a Set of Student type. This method is supposed to sort the
   HashSet of students in an increasing manner of their marks. Since the marks are primitive double type, you are
   supposed to use their natural ordering. If two students have same marks, use class roll number. Create a separate
   execution java class called Main.java and call both the methods given above!
