## Task 6

Create a java class file called `SmartPhone.java`. The `SmartPhone.java` class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the IMEI number of the smartphone, as a reference `Long` type value. **IMMUTABLE**
2. a private field to store the name of the smartphone, as a reference `String` type value. **IMMUTABLE**
3. a private field to store the price of the smartphone, as a primitive `double` type value.
4. a private field to store the screen size of the smartphone(in inches), as a primitive `byte` type value.
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the `equals()`,
   `toString()` and the `hashCode()` methods.

Create a java class file called `OnlineShop.java`. The class should contain the following two methods:

* ```java
   public List<SmartPhone> getListOfSmartPhones(Set<SmartPhone> smartPhones, byte requiredScreenSize) {} 
   ```
  This method inputs a `Set` of `SmartPhone` type and a required screen size value of `byte` type. This method will
  iterate through all the smartphone objects' set and find out the smartphones whose screen size is at least as large as
  the required screen size value. If you find a phone whose screen size is lesser, decrease its price by 10%

* ```java
   public List<SmartPhone> findBudgetSmartPhones(Set<SmartPhone> smartPhones) {}
   ```
  This method inputs a `Set` of `SmartPhone` type and returns a `List` of `SmartPhone` type. A budget smartphone is a
  phone whose price is less than or equal to â‚¹ 10,000.  
  If you do not find any such phone in the set of smartphones, make sure that your method does not return `null`!

Create a separate execution java class called `Main.java` and call both the methods given above!
