Task 9 Create a java class file called Patient.java. The Patient.java class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the patient id, as a primitive short type value.
2. a private field to store the name of the patient, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE
3. a private field to store the age of the patient, as a primitive byte type value.
4. a private field to store the contact number of the patient, as a primitive long type value. IMMUTABLE
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
   toString() and the hashCode() methods. Create a java class file called PatientHelper.java. The class should contain
   the following two methods:
1. public Set<Patient> getAllOldPatients(List<Patient> patients) {} This method will return all the patients whose age
   is at least 60 or above. If there is no such patient, make sure that the method does not return null. The method
   should not return duplicate items as well.
2. public List<Patient>
   sortPatientsAccordingToDecreasingAge(List<Patient> patients) {} This method will sort the patients' list according to
   decreasing age, a patient with a greater age should come first in the list. Use either a lambda expression or a
   method reference to do this. Create a separate execution java class called Main.java and call both the methods given
   above!
