Task 11 Create a java class file called Laptop.java. The Laptop.java class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the name of the laptop, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE
2. a private field to store the ram of the laptop in GBs, as a primitive byte type value.
3. a private field to store the price of the laptop in INR, as a primitive double type value.
4. a private field to indicate the availability of the laptop, as a primitive boolean type value. IMMUTABLE
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
   toString() and the hashCode() methods. Create a java class file called LaptopBuyerHelper.java. The class should
   contain the following two methods:
1. public List<Laptop> getLaptopList(List<Laptop> laptops, byte ramCapacity) {} This method will return all the laptop
   objects whose ram capacity is at least (or more) than the ram capacity specified in the parameters. A laptop should
   only be returned from the method if it is available in stock. If no such laptop is available, the method should not
   return null. The method should also not return duplicates.
2. public Set<Laptop> findLaptop(List<Laptop> laptops, byte ramCapacity, double price) {} This method will return all
   the laptop objects whose price is at most (or lower) than the price specified in the parameters, if showing a laptop
   with a different price, make sure the ram should be the same. If no such laptop is available, the method should not
   return null. The method should also not return duplicates. Create a separate execution java class called Main.java
   and call both the methods given above!
