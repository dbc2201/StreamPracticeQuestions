Task 7 Create a java class file called Book.java. The Book.java class should contain the following members:

1. a private field to store the ISBN number of the book, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE
2. a private field to store the name of the book, as a reference String type value. IMMUTABLE
3. a private field to store the name of the author of the book, as a reference String type value.
4. a private field to store the price of the book, as a primitive double type value.
5. the necessary getter/setter methods for the private fields, at least two constructors for this class, the equals(),
   toString() and the hashCode() methods. Create a java class file called CollegeLibrary.java. The class should contain
   the following two methods:
1. public List<Book> getListOfExpensiceBooks(Set<Book> books) {} This method input a Set of Book type and returns a List
   of Book type. An expensive book is a book whose price is at least 5,000 INR or more. If such a book exists, make sure
   that the returning list should not have duplicate names. If there are two books by the same author, even with
   different names, they should be considered as same.
2. public Book findBookDeatilsByISBN(List<Book> books, String ISBN) {} This method will find a book by the ISBN number
   and return it. Make sure even if there is not such book, the method should not return null. Create a separate
   execution java class called Main.java and call both the methods given above!
